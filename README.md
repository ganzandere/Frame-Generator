Cute and simple though not incredibly useful `Python` GUI app based on `customtkinter`. Made for submitting more advanced frame patterns to render farm in Thinkbox Deadline format, before we found Deadline already has formatting methods for these. `deadline_format()` inside generator.py could still be useful for other projects involving frame lists.
